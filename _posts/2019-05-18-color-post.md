# What a colorful post!

Changing colors

Can we change the color of this post from brown to green? 😉

<!--more-->

## How does it work?

Basically you need to add just one thing, the color:

```yml
---
layout: post
title: Color Post
color: green
---
```


The background used is `lineart.png` from [xukimseven](https://github.com/xukimseven) you can edit it in the config file. 
If you want another one, put it in `/assets/img` as well. 
> ⚠️ It's a bit hacking the css in the `post.html`
